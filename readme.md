This application will be an implementation of the boardgame 'Root'. 

Root is a game in which different woodland factions compete to dominate the forest. It's gameplay is Risk-like, extended through class-based asymmetric gameplay.

The progression of this application is planned as follows:

- Design base game models (clearings, generic pieces)
- Choose a unit testing framework, begin writing sanity tests for base models
- Implement an example faction, making updates to base models as necessary
- Add game rules and console interactivity
- Implement other factions
- Build a user interface (might be a good opportunity to pick React back up)
